  Hi there!
</h1>

I'm Dmitrii, a versatile software engineer and architect with over a decade of experience. My journey in tech started with C, C++, and Python, and has evolved to encompass web development, AI, and data science. Inspired by Robert Heinlein's quote, "Specialization is for insects," I love exploring diverse technologies and solving complex problems.

When I'm not coding, I cherish time with my family, creating music, and dreaming about space adventures. Feel free to connect if you want to chat about tech, science, or just share a laugh. Cheers!
