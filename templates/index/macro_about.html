      I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for coding and a keen interest in
      science. I started my journey in software engineering with C, C++, and
      Python, but my curiosity has led me to explore a variety of fields
      including web development, AI, and data science. Inspired by Robert
      Heinlein's quote, "Specialization is for insects," I strive to keep my
      skills diverse and adaptable.

      My career has taken me from small startups to large corporations, allowing
      me to contribute to a myriad of exciting projects. Whether it's
      architecting a complex system or diving into the nitty-gritty of coding, I
      thrive on solving problems and creating innovative solutions.

      When I'm not immersed in code, I cherish spending time with my family. My
      wife Dasha and daughter Varya are my greatest joys. We love exploring new
      places, visiting museums, and enjoying nature. Varvara dreams bigâ€”she's
      aspiring to be everything from a scientist to a dragon! Her boundless
      curiosity drives her, and we often find ourselves dreaming up stories and
      making music together. Dasha, a budding data scientist, shares my love for
      physics and the cosmos.
